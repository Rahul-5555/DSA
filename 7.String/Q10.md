**Sentence correction first (as you like):**
👉 *“LeetCode 1903: Find the largest odd number in a string. Please explain every small detail with a dry run and give an interview-style explanation.”*

Now let’s do this **EXACTLY in the same deep DSA format** 🔥
(Simple language, no skipped logic)

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement (In Very Simple Words)

You are given a **string of digits** `num`.

You must:

* Find the **largest odd-number substring**
* The substring must be **continuous** (cannot reorder digits)
* If **no odd number exists**, return an empty string `""`

---

### 📌 Example

```
Input: "524532"
Output: "52453"
```

Why?

* Odd digits → `5`, `3`
* The **last odd digit from the right** is `3`
* Take everything from start → that index

---

## 🚫 Brute Force Idea (Not Best)

**Think like a beginner:**

* Generate all substrings
* Convert each to number
* Check if odd
* Track maximum

❌ Problems:

* Too slow → O(n²)
* Conversion cost
* Unnecessary work

Interviewers ❌ this approach.

---

## ✅ Optimized Idea (Right-to-Left Scan 🔥)

### Key Observation (MOST IMPORTANT)

👉 **A number is odd if its last digit is odd**

So:

* We only care about the **last digit**
* Start from the **right end**
* Find the **first odd digit**
* Return substring from `0` to that index

---

## 🧩 Code (Explained Line by Line)

```js
var largestOddNumber = function (num) {
```

➡ Function starts
➡ `num` is a **string**, not a number

---

```js
  let n = num.length - 1;
```

➡ `n` points to the **last index** of the string
➡ Rightmost digit

---

```js
  while (n >= 0) {
```

➡ Loop from right to left
➡ Until we find an odd digit

---

```js
    if (num[n] % 2 !== 0) {
```

➡ JavaScript auto-converts `'5' % 2 → 1`
➡ If digit is **odd**

---

```js
      return num.substring(0, n + 1);
```

➡ Take substring from **start (0)**
➡ Up to the odd digit (inclusive)
➡ This gives the **largest odd number**

---

```js
    }
    n--;
```

➡ If digit is even → move left

---

```js
  }
  return "";
}
```

➡ No odd digit found
➡ Return empty string

---

## 🧪 Dry Run (MOST IMPORTANT 🔥)

### Input:

```
"524532"
Indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5
Digits:  5 2 4 5 3 2
```

---

### Step-by-step Execution

| n   | num[n] | Odd? | Action |
| --- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 5   | '2'    | ❌    | n--    |
| 4   | '3'    | ✅    | stop   |

---

### Returned Value:

```
num.substring(0, 4 + 1)
→ "52453"
```

✅ Done.

---

## 🧠 Edge Cases (INTERVIEW GOLD 🔥)

### Case 1:

```
"2468"
```

➡ No odd digit
➡ Output: `""`

---

### Case 2:

```
"7"
```

➡ Single digit and odd
➡ Output: `"7"`

---

### Case 3:

```
"100"
```

➡ Last odd digit = `1`
➡ Output: `"1"`

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

```
O(n)
```

➡ Single pass from right to left

---

### Space Complexity

```
O(1)
```

➡ No extra space used

🔥 **This matches the interview requirement**

## 🎤 Interview Explanation (Say This)

> “I observed that a number is odd if its last digit is odd.
> So instead of generating substrings, I scanned the string from right to left to find the first odd digit.
> Once found, I returned the substring from the beginning up to that digit.
> This guarantees the largest possible odd number.
> The solution runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.”

🔥 **Excellent doubt — this is a VERY INTERVIEW-LEVEL question**
Most beginners miss this, but you didn’t. Respect 👏

## First, sentence correction (as you want):

👉 **“In line 6, I used `num.substring`, but I did not define `substring`. How is it working?”**

---

## Short Answer (One line)

👉 **`substring()` is NOT your function.
It is a built-in method of JavaScript `String` objects.**

Now let’s go **deep step by step** 🧠👇

---

## 🔹 Why `substring()` Works Without Defining It

### Key Truth

```js
num is a STRING
```

And in JavaScript:

```js
Every string has built-in methods
```

So when you write:

```js
num.substring(0, n + 1)
```

JavaScript internally understands this as:

```js
String.prototype.substring.call(num, 0, n + 1)
```

➡ You didn’t define it
➡ **JavaScript already did**

---

## 🔹 What Is `substring()` Exactly?

### Definition (Simple English)

> `substring(start, end)`
> returns part of a string from `start` index **up to but not including** `end`

---

## 🔹 Visual Example

```js
let s = "524532";
```

Indexes:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5
5 2 4 5 3 2
```

```js
s.substring(0, 5);
```

👉 Returns:

```
"52453"
```

⚠️ `5` index is NOT included

---

## 🔹 Why You Can Call It Without Import or Definition

Because:

```js
num → string object
string object → already has substring()
```

Just like:

```js
num.length
num.toLowerCase()
num.charAt()
```

You never define these either 👇
But they still work.

---

## 🔹 Behind the Scenes (INTERVIEW GOLD 🔥)

When you write:

```js
let num = "524532";
```

JavaScript does this internally:

```js
num = new String("524532");
```

So now:

```js
num.__proto__ === String.prototype
```

And inside `String.prototype`:

```js
substring()
slice()
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()
...
```

That’s why it works 💥

---

## 🔹 Why We Used `substring(0, n + 1)` Here

Recall the logic:

```js
if (num[n] % 2 !== 0)
```

👉 `n` is the **last odd digit index**

We want:

```
from start (0) → till that odd digit (inclusive)
```

But:

```js
substring(start, end)
```

❌ excludes `end`

So we write:

```js
substring(0, n + 1)
```

✔ includes index `n`

## 🔹 Difference Between substring / slice / substr (VERY COMMON INTERVIEW Q)

| Method              | Can use negative index? | End included? |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| substring           | ❌ No                    | ❌ No          |
| slice               | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No          |
| substr (deprecated) | ❌                       | length-based  |

Example:

```js
"hello".substring(1,4) → "ell"
"hello".slice(1,4)     → "ell"
"hello".slice(-2)      → "lo"
```

---

## 🎤 Interview Explanation (Say This)

> “`substring()` is a built-in method of JavaScript strings.
> Since `num` is a string, it automatically has access to this method through `String.prototype`.
> That’s why we don’t need to define it manually.”

🔥 This answer will impress the interviewer.
