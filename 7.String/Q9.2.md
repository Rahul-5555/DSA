Great 👍
**First, your sentence corrected (as promised):**
👉 *“LeetCode 125: Check if a string is a palindrome or not **without using extra space**.”*

Now let’s break this **line by line, slowly, deeply, with dry run and interview explanation** 🔥
This is an **INTERVIEW-READY solution**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement (Very Simple Words)

You are given a string `s`.

You must:

* Ignore **capital vs small letters**
* Ignore **non-alphanumeric characters** (like `, : space @`)
* Check if the string reads the **same forward and backward**
* ❌ Do **NOT** use extra space (no new array / reversed string)

---

### 📌 Example

```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```

Why?
After cleaning:

```
amanaplanacanalpanama
```

Same from both sides.

---

## 🚫 Brute Force (Rejected in Interview)

**Idea:**

* Clean the string
* Reverse it
* Compare

❌ Problem:

* Uses extra space
* Interviewer asked: **“without extra space”**

So ❌ rejected.

---

## ✅ Optimized Idea (Two Pointer Technique)

We:

* Keep **two pointers**
* One from **start (i)**
* One from **end (j)**
* Skip invalid characters
* Compare valid characters only

This uses:

* ⏱ O(n) time
* 🧠 O(1) extra space (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)

## 🧩 Code (Your Code – Explained Line by Line)

```js
var isPalindrome = function (s) {
```

➡ Function starts, takes string `s`

---

```js
  s = s.toLowerCase();
```

➡ Converts entire string to lowercase
➡ So `'A'` and `'a'` are treated the same

---

```js
  let i = 0;
  let j = s.length - 1;
```

➡ `i` → left pointer (start)
➡ `j` → right pointer (end)

---

```js
  while (i < j) {
```

➡ Loop runs **until pointers meet**
➡ Once crossed → checking is complete

---

### 🔍 LEFT SIDE CHECK

```js
    if (!s[i].match(/[a-z0-9]/)) {
      i++;
    }
```

➡ If `s[i]` is **NOT alphanumeric**
➡ Skip it
➡ Move left pointer forward

Example skipped chars:

```
' ', ',', ':', '@'
```

---

### 🔍 RIGHT SIDE CHECK

```js
    else if (!s[j].match(/[a-z0-9]/)) {
      j--;
    }
```

➡ Same logic for right pointer
➡ Skip invalid characters

---

### ✅ CHARACTER MATCH

```js
    else if (s[i] === s[j]) {
      i++; j--;
    }
```

➡ Both are valid characters
➡ If equal → move both pointers inward

---

### ❌ NOT A PALINDROME

```js
    else {
      return false;
    }
```

➡ Characters differ
➡ Immediately return `false`

---

```js
  }
  return true;
}
```

➡ Loop finished without mismatch
➡ It IS a palindrome

---

## 🧪 Dry Run (MOST IMPORTANT 🔥)

### Input:

```
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
```

After lowercase:

```
"a man, a plan, a canal: panama"
```

---

### Step-by-step Pointer Movement

| i   | s[i]  | j   | s[j] | Action           |
| --- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 0   | a     | 29  | a    | match → i++, j-- |
| 1   | space | 28  | m    | skip i           |
| 2   | m     | 28  | m    | match            |
| 3   | a     | 27  | a    | match            |
| 4   | n     | 26  | n    | match            |
| 5   | ,     | 25  | a    | skip i           |
| 6   | space | 25  | a    | skip i           |
| 7   | a     | 25  | a    | match            |
| ... | ...   | ... | ...  | continues        |

✅ No mismatch found
➡ Return **true**

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

```
O(n)
```

Why?

* Each character visited at most once

---

### Space Complexity

```
O(1)
```

Why?

* No extra array or string
* Only pointers used

🔥 **THIS IS WHY INTERVIEWERS LOVE THIS SOLUTION**

## 🎤 Interview Explanation (Say This Confidently)

> “I used a two-pointer approach to solve this problem without extra space.
> One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end.
> I skip non-alphanumeric characters and compare valid characters only.
> If at any point characters don’t match, I return false.
> Otherwise, if pointers cross successfully, the string is a palindrome.
> This solution works in O(n) time and O(1) space.”
