# Group Anagrams – Frequency Array Approach

## Idea
Anagram words have the same character frequency.

## Steps
1. Create a frequency array of size 26 for each word.
2. Convert frequency array into a string key.
3. Use hashmap to group words by key.
4. Return hashmap values.

## Time Complexity
O(n * m)

## Space Complexity
O(n)

## Example
Input:
["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output:
[
 ["eat","tea","ate"],
 ["tan","nat"],
 ["bat"]
]
