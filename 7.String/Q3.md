Excellent 👍
**Approach 3 is the MOST elegant version** — fewer lines, same logic, very interview-friendly.

I’ll explain it **slowly, perfectly, and logically**, so every condition makes sense in your head.

---

## 🎯 Goal (Same as before)

Find the **length of the last word** in a string
✔ Ignore trailing spaces
✔ Count characters of the last word only

---

## 🧩 Your Code (Clean & Optimal)

```js
var lengthOfLastWord = function (s) {
  let n = s.length - 1;

  let count = 0;
  while (n >= 0) {
    if (s[n] != " ") {
      ++count;
    }
    else if (count > 0) {
      break;
    }
    --n;
  }
  return count;
}
```

---

## 🧠 BIG IDEA (One Sentence)

> **Start from the end, count letters when you see them, and stop when you hit a space *after* counting has started.**

No extra loops.
No trimming.
Everything in **one loop** 🔥

---

## 🟢 STEP 1: Start from last index

```js
let n = s.length - 1;
```

📌 `n` points to the **last character** of the string

Example:

```
"Hello World   "
              ↑ n
```

---

## 🟢 STEP 2: Counter initialized

```js
let count = 0;
```

📌 `count = 0` means:

> “I haven’t started counting the last word yet.”

---

## 🟢 STEP 3: Single while loop (Magic happens here)

```js
while (n >= 0) {
```

You scan the string **backwards**.

---

### 🔹 CASE 1: Character is NOT a space

```js
if (s[n] != " ") {
  ++count;
}
```

### 🧠 Meaning:

> “I found a letter → it belongs to the last word.”

✔ Start counting
✔ Continue counting

Example:

```
"Hello World"
        ↑ d → count = 1
       ↑ l → count = 2
       ↑ r → count = 3
```

---

### 🔹 CASE 2: Character IS a space

```js
else if (count > 0) {
  break;
}
```

### 🧠 Meaning:

> “I already started counting a word, and now I hit a space — the word is over.”

📌 This space **separates words**, so stop.

Example:

```
"Hello World"
     ↑ space (count = 5) → STOP
```

---

### 🔹 Why check `count > 0`?

This avoids breaking **too early** on trailing spaces.

Example:

```
"Hello World   "
              ↑ space, but count = 0 → IGNORE
```

So:
✔ trailing spaces are skipped automatically
✔ break only happens **after last word counting starts**

---

### 🔹 Move left

```js
--n;
```

Always move backward unless loop ends.

---

## 🟢 STEP 4: Return result

```js
return count;
```

📌 `count` now contains length of last word

---

## 🧪 Dry Run Example (Important)

### Input:

```
"   fly me   to   the moon  "
```

### Reverse scan:

| Char  | count | Action |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| space | 0     | ignore |
| space | 0     | ignore |
| n     | 1     | count  |
| o     | 2     | count  |
| o     | 3     | count  |
| m     | 4     | count  |
| space | 4     | BREAK  |

✔ Output = **4**

## ⚡ Why This Is the BEST Version

| Feature     | Status |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Single loop | ✅      |
| No trim()   | ✅      |
| No split()  | ✅      |
| O(n) time   | ✅      |
| O(1) space  | ✅      |
| Clean logic | 🔥      |

## 🧠 Interview One-Line Explanation

> “I scan the string from the end, start counting letters when I find a non-space character, and stop when I encounter a space after counting has begun.”
